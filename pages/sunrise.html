<h2>Sunrise</h2>
<a href="../index.html">Index</a>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Sunrise is a 3D brush-based map editor designed for creating levels for closed world style game engines such as Source and idTech. Levels are constructed primarily out of convex polyhedral brushes and compiled using an integrated map compiler that performs brush clipping, hidden surface removal and construction of spatial acceleration structures such as BSPs and BVHs to produce an optimized map. The current focus is on providing an intuitive and fluid interface for fast creation and iteration of basic, coarse-grained map geometry, however, in future versions I aim to support a wider set of geometry primitives such as curves, displacements, voxels and meshes as well as other features such as procedural meshes and procedural prefabs, and more map compilation features such as lightmap, lightprobe and reflection probe generation.
